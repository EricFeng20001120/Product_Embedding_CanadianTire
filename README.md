This project is a collaboration between the University of Toronto and Canadian Tire Corporation, aimed at developing advanced embedding methods for AI/ML applications to improve data representation and model performance.

## Project Background

The focus of this project is to leverage CTC data to improve demand forecasting, product recommendation, and website search functionalities through the use of AI/ML models. The main challenge addressed is the need for Canadian Tire Corporation to embed their data into dense vectors to enhance their AI/ML models.

## Problem Statement

Canadian Tire Corporation requires sophisticated methods to represent their data with dense vectors to boost the performance of AI/ML models for various applications within the company.

## Embedding Techniques

### Product Embeddings
- Pre-Trained NLP (Google)
- TFIDF
- Prod2Vec

### Store Embeddings
- Entity Embedding
- Knowledge Graph

## Findings

The project has successfully demonstrated that embedding techniques can create clusters of similar products based on characteristics. This has significant implications for the design and implementation of AI/ML applications.

## Results

- **Product Classification Model:** Improved Test Accuracy by 7.47%, from 76.26% to 83.73% using NLP embeddings.
- **Sales Forecasting Model:** Increased Test R Squared Scores by 9.40%, from 50.90% to 60.30% using Entity Embeddings.

## Future Implications

The embeddings are set to play a crucial role in:
- Optimizing store layout
- Creating a customer service chatbot
- Optimizing local marketing strategies

## Conclusion

Embeddings will be utilized in AI/ML models to enhance forecasting, product recommendation, and more. Canadian Tire can extend this research and scale to industry-level implementation.
